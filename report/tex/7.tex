We have implemented a proof-of-concept version of the tPSI-AD system in Python. Our analysis confirms that even with slightly modified cryptographic primitives, we achieve equivalent security as the original protocol. While the system  (and the fuzzy variant) are cryptographically sound, its mere existence inspires ethical concerns. An authoritarian government could ``request'' the scanning for other material (such as pornography, and political, religious, racial, and LGBTQIA+ material) if Apple  wanted to continue selling products in their country. The slippery slope argument is befitting.
